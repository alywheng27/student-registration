# Student Registration System

This is a web application for managing student registrations, built with Next.js and React. The project is bootstrapped with `create-next-app` and configured with a modern, robust toolchain focused on code quality, maintainability, and accessibility.

## âœ¨ Features & Tech Stack

This project utilizes a range of modern technologies to ensure a high-quality development experience and a performant end product.

- **Framework**: Next.js - A comprehensive React framework for production.
- **Language**: TypeScript - For static typing and improved developer experience.
- **UI Library**: React - For building interactive user interfaces.
- **Code Quality**: ESLint - To find and fix problems in JavaScript/TypeScript code. It is configured with:
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`: Enforces the rules of hooks to prevent common mistakes.
  - `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`: Checks for accessibility issues in your JSX.
  - `eslint-plugin-import`: Ensures module imports are correct and follow best practices.
- **Font Optimization**: This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Geist, the Vercel font family.
